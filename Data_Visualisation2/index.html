        <h2>About Kangaroos</h2>
        <p>Kangaroos are iconic marsupials native to Australia, known for their powerful hind legs, strong tails, and distinctive hopping gait. They belong to the family Macropodidae, which means "big foot." With several species, including the Eastern Grey, Red, and Western Grey kangaroos, they thrive in diverse habitats ranging from forests to grasslands.</p>
        <p>Kangaroos play a vital role in Australia’s ecosystem, serving as herbivores that help maintain plant communities. They are social animals, often found in groups called mobs, which provide protection against predators. Adapted to Australia’s variable climate, they can survive with minimal water, obtaining moisture from the vegetation they consume.</p>
        <p>In New South Wales, kangaroos are a common sight, often spotted in national parks and rural areas. They hold cultural significance for Indigenous Australians and continue to be a symbol of Australia’s unique wildlife. Conservation efforts aim to balance their populations with land use and biodiversity needs, ensuring these remarkable creatures remain a vital part of Australia's natural heritage.</p>

        <h2>Kangaroo Map</h2>
        <p>This map tells the story of how different kangaroo species are spread across the landscape of New South Wales, illustrating how kangaroo populations are linked to both natural and human-made environments. The variation in kangaroo sightings provides insights into the following key aspects:</p>
        
        <h3>Species Habitat Preference</h3>
        <p>From the map, we can observe the clustering of different kangaroo species in certain areas. For instance, Eastern Grey Kangaroos are more prevalent towards the central and coastal regions, while the Red Kangaroo sightings are concentrated further west, closer to the arid inland.</p>
        
        <h3>Impact of Geographic Features</h3>
        <p>The location of rivers and roads gives context to the sightings. Kangaroos may tend to be near water sources like rivers, especially during dry seasons, and roads may intersect with kangaroo habitats, influencing human-wildlife interactions.</p>
        
        <h3>Biodiversity Monitoring</h3>
        <p>By tracking where kangaroos are located over time, scientists, policymakers, and conservationists can identify regions of high kangaroo density and understand how populations might be shifting in response to factors like climate change, habitat loss, or human expansion.</p>
        
        <h3>Human-Wildlife Coexistence</h3>
        <p>The proximity of kangaroo populations to major roads could indicate areas of potential conflict between humans and wildlife, such as vehicle collisions with kangaroos. Understanding these patterns can help inform decisions around road signage or wildlife corridors to ensure safer interactions between humans and kangaroos.</p>
        
        <h3>Time Trends and Environmental Impact</h3>
        <p>By using the interactive slider to explore how kangaroo populations change over time, we can gain insights into potential environmental impacts on kangaroo populations, such as droughts, bushfires, or land development, which might affect kangaroo habitats and cause shifts in population density or location.</p>

        <h2>Scatter Plot of Sightings</h2>
        <p>This chart tells the story of how kangaroo populations are being managed across New South Wales, balancing wildlife sustainability with economic and environmental needs. Over the years, we see variations in both population sizes and the number of kangaroos harvested, likely reflecting changing environmental conditions, population dynamics, and regulatory policies.</p>
        
        <p>In zones like <strong>Coonabarabran</strong>, which shows both large populations and higher harvest amounts, we can infer that the local environment supports a significant kangaroo population, necessitating higher harvest quotas to prevent overpopulation and environmental degradation. On the other hand, areas like <strong>Tibooburra</strong> and <strong>Griffith North</strong> show much lower levels of harvesting likely due to lower local demand for harvesting.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Insights:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Population vs. Harvest Amount:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Zones with larger kangaroo populations generally have a higher number of kangaroos harvested. This makes sense because areas with larger populations can sustainably support more harvesting.</li>
              <li>There is variability in how population size affects the harvest amount, with some zones showing higher harvest amounts even for smaller populations, indicating localized or regional factors influencing harvesting practices.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Increasing Harvest Amount:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Population Growth:</strong> Favorable environmental conditions like increased rainfall boost food supply, leading to kangaroo population growth.</li>
              <li><strong>Government Regulations:</strong> Authorities may adjust harvest quotas to manage populations, especially if overpopulation poses risks to the environment or agriculture.</li>
              <li><strong>Economic Demand:</strong> Higher demand for kangaroo products or improved harvesting methods may make harvesting more economically viable.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Harvesting Sustainability:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>High kangaroo populations can lead to overgrazing, damaging ecosystems and competing with livestock for food.</li>
              <li>Harvesting controls help manage these effects.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Regional Variations:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Coonabarabran and Broken Hill show notably high harvest amounts, especially in recent years, indicating larger populations or higher demand for harvesting.</li>
              <li>Tibooburra and Griffith South show smaller population sizes and harvest amounts, suggesting more restrictive harvesting limits to preserve population levels.</li>
            </ul>

          <li>The demand for kangaroo products, such as meat and skins, influences harvesting decisions:
            <ul>
              <li>Male kangaroos, being larger, are often preferred for certain products.</li>
              <li>Female kangaroos may be harvested more heavily in years focused on controlling population sizes rather than maximizing product yield.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Wildlife Conservation and Sustainability:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Ensuring healthy and sustainable kangaroo populations is a priority for Australian wildlife management.
            <ul>
